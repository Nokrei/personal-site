            I am a web developer focusing mainly on the front-end, however I
            have the ability to deliver full stack applications as well. <br />
            <br /> My tech stack is HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, ReactJS,
            NodeJS(Express), MongoDB(Mongoose). I have experience using Version
            Control Systems(GIT) and Package Managers(NPM). <br /> <br />
            In my projects I practice the principles of Responsive Web Design,
            Mobile First Design and I follow the BEM methodology. <br /> <br />A
            large part of my professional career revolved around IT, but it is
            in web development where I found my true passion and calling. <br />
            <br />
            Recently I have completed the Astrolabs Full-Stack Developer
            Bootcamp, which greatly supplemented my existing skills and
            knowledge. I am extremely passionate about my work and I always want
            to learn more. <br />
            <br />I am open to both freelance opportunities and full-time
            positions.
